# Coffe Delivery

This project is a front-end simulator for an online coffee shop. It is not integrated with a back-end, but was created to simulate the front-end of a real application. The application can be accessed at: http://kursi.com.br/coffee-delivery

The application has three screens:

- On the first screen, the user has access to the list of all products, and can choose the desired quantity of each of them and proceed to the checkout screen.
- On the checkout screen, the user has a form to fill in the delivery address data, inform the payment method, remove or change the quantity of the items that were inserted in the cart, and the total amount will be displayed.
- When the user finalizes the purchase, he is redirected to a page that shows that the order was successfully completed.

This project was created as a challenge within Rocketseat's "Ignite" course, with the objective of putting into practice skills that were learned in the course, such as the creation of a React application, styled components, useContext, SPA, forms, Typescript, and much more.

To build the application, libraries such as Phosphor React, React Hook Form, React Router Dom, Styled Components, eslint, and others were used.
